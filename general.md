<h1>General</h1>

+ Find the most frequent integer in an array
+ Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)
+ Given 2 integer arrays, determine of the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}
+ Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)
+ Find the only element in an array that only occurs once.
+ Find the common elements of 2 int arrays
+ Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers
+ Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})
+ Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers
+ Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int
+ Implement parseInt
+ Implement squareroot function
+ Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)
+ Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *
+ HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()
+ HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)
