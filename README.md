# Interview Resources

## Introduction

Interview Resources aims to bring you a comprehensive list of interview questions commonly heard in today's job-hunting market.

The collection will be separated by interview type, rather than company, so that you can apply the questions across industries.

*Most of these will be based on Entry Level SWE Questions that have been asked. There may also be Internship ones as well and Code Challenges given.*

Ready. Set. Land the Offer.
